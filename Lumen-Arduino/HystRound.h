Title: Lumen LED Light Embedded Microcontroller Software
Description: This file is used on the ATtiny45 microcontroller
on the Lumen LED Light and controls the dimming of the light. It can be
control by two methods, first is standard servo PWM pulse from
1100-1900 microseconds. The second is a logic high value on the signal
line. Additionally, a thermistor is used to sense temperature and automatically
dim the light if it is overheating.
